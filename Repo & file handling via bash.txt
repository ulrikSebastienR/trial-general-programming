Git bash and linux commands are similar at the time of tried-today.

Create a file
	touch filename
	vi filename
	notepad filename
remove file and folder	
	rm -r to remove file
	rm -rf to remove folder

mkdir "folder name" to create a folder name with spaces
	mkdir folder name creates two folders with folder & name


git clone




Create Repository via git bash/adding new file from your local folder
	cd to change present working directory to the folder where your files are stored. This process is similar to a refresh.
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/ulrikSebastienR/Python-Commands-tried-today.git
	git remote -v
	git push origin master

remove a file first in your local folder and do a refresh by
	git add .
	git commit -m "your message"
	git push origin master
or refresh and addition together by
	git commit -all OR git commit -a 
	git push origin master
	but here vim will ask you to press i, esc, :x! 

Remove a file from git and your local folder
	git rm file1.txt
	git commit -m "remove file1.txt" 
	N.B. : If you don't delete the file from your local folder and delete only from git web repository, you will not be able to further update your repo from bash.

Rename a file
	git mv old_filename new_filename
	git status
	git commit -m "Rename file"
	
Concatenate two text files
	Create a file first say file3.txt
	cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
	now git add. git commit git push origin master

status check
	git status


Updating a file via git bash
	git commit -all OR git commit -a 
	git push origin master

restoring a file to discard changes in working directory
	git restore <file>
